# Project Topic Proposal:

## 1.Chosen Dataset:

Url of the API: https://www.iqair.com/air-pollution-data-api The dataset includes forecast, current, history and pollution data for AQI value which is a measurement for pollution, temperature in Celsius, wind speed, wind direction, atmospheric pressure, humidity and weather icon code for supported countries, states, cities, nearest city, specified city, station, nearest station, and specified station. API key is required.  

## 2.Application Name: 

Pollution in Windy City

## 3.	Project Topic/Objective: 

In this project I aim to monitor Chicago’s air pollution and compare with its past air pollution. This application will also compare its current air pollution with Los Angeles’s current data and see differences between two cities. In addition to pollution this will also compare current temperature, humidity and wind speed data in Chicago with 48 hours data and forecast data. The questions I hope to find out are: 
     
What is the difference between Chicago and Los Angeles in terms of air pollution?

How does temperature changes in Chicago for 96 hours period (48h past 24current and 24h forecast)?

How temperature is being affected by wind speed and humidity in Chicago for same period above?  

## 4.	Motivation: 

I’d like to use this dataset because I like to read about environment when I have free times. Air pollution is the one of major problems in the world I want to examine Chicago’s air pollution with real numbers using this API.  Also, I believe that here in Chicago humidity and wind affect temperature more than usual. Another aspect of my project will be to assess if wind and humidity have an effect on temperature in Chicago.
